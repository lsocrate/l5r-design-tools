Lost vs phoenix in round 1 of top cut in a not so close game, since tsuke was really powerful vs swarm and I still have to figure out how to play against decoy. \n\nOverall a good performance against really tough opponents.\n\nThank you all,\n\nCBM95 ","version_number":"0.7","cards":{"kinki":3,"pride":1,"banzai":3,"disarm":3,"censure":3,"deathseeker":2,"matsu-gohei":2,"matsu-sakura":3,"akodo-zentaro":3,"assassination":2,"ayubune-pilot":1,"ikoma-prodigy":3,"ikoma-tsanuri":3,"seeker-of-air":1,"elegant-tessen":3,"noble-vanguard":3,"staging-ground":3,"the-art-of-war":1,"battle-aspirant":3,"corner-the-prey":2,"feeding-an-army":3,"fortune-s-field":1,"matsu-berserker":3,"promising-hohei":3,"take-up-command":3,"yatakabune-port":1,"captive-audience":3,"fallen-in-battle":1,"gifted-tactician":3,"honored-veterans":3,"meticulous-scout":3,"before-the-throne":1,"long-journey-home":2,"courteous-greeting":1,"makeshift-war-camp":2,"tactical-ingenuity":3,"ikoma-master-hunter":3,"samurai-of-integrity":3},"published_date":"2023-06-29T17:23:15.030Z","created_at":"2023-06-29T17:23:01.481Z","user_id":"auth0|60c6000030c345006acc1b4a","username":"Comebackman95"}
